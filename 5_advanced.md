In the last chapter of this guide, we first introduce the overall architecture of the Pydio Cells Server and then put the focus on specific features to go one step further, namely:

- Embedded scheduler
- Webdav server
- REST API

These features are just but a few of the next surprises we have prepared for you with this entirely rewritten piece of software.  
Now that the version 1.0 of Pydio Cells is out, we will quickly build on it and add more cool features very soon; stay tuned!
