In the last chapter of this guide, we will put the focus on specific features of Pydio Cells that bring high added value:

Namely, for the time being: 
- the embedded scheduler
- the webdav server
- the REST API

These features are just but a few of the next surprises we have prepared for you with this entirely rewritten version. Now that the version 1.0 of Pydio Cells is out, we will quickly build on it and add more cool features very soon; stay tuned!
