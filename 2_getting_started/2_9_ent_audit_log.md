#### [ED] Audit logs

On the **Enterprise Edition** you have an audit log, an audit log stores every single event/detail allowing you to retrace them if the need arise.
For example if you have a security breach it will allow you to retrace the events back to when the breach happened and see what was compromised.

It's is located in the logs folder `~/.config/pydio/cells/logs` filed under the name `audit.log`.

You can also export logs from the pydio cells interface go to **Backend > Logs** and then, but first you have to filter them as said in the previous section [system_logs]()
then you will be able to click on the export button, choose your format CSV or XLSX.
