With the 
#### [ED] Audit logs

On the **Enterprise Edition** you have an audit log, an audit log stores every single event/detail allowing you to retrace them if the need arise.
For example if you have a security breach it will allow you to retrace the events back to when the breach happened and see what was compromised.

It's is located in the logs folder `~/.config/pydio/cells/logs` filed under the name `audit.log`.
