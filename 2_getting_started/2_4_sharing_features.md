### Sharing with Cells

Pydio Cells delivers file sharing and collaboration, in a way that is more familiar, comfortable and intuitive for users of modern collaborative apps. It lets users decide how to share files and information, based on knowledge of their own teams, workflows and working patterns. This end-user freedom also takes the responsibility for creating effective workspaces away from overburdened administrators.

The Cells concept will be familiar to modern workers used to collaborating on “channels” within popular group-chat applications. 
Cells can be shared internally or externally to the organisation, with users able to add new individuals and groups to the Cell.  In-app, instant messaging within each Cell, then provides a focused channel for group communication around the theme.

End-users can now create their own, flexible "Cells": combining files and folders from any location, or picking users from their address book.

#### Creating Cells from scratch

When using the "Create Cell" button in the left-hand column, the following menu is displayed:

* **Add an existing Folder** : Pick an existing folder from any of your current workspaces, to feed the Cell with data. You can also leave the cell empty and a dedicated folder will be created on the underlying storage.

Click on **Create Cell Now!** to finish the process.

#### Creating Cells from folders/files

When using the **Share** action (either in right-click menu or in the information column), one can directly add a folder or a file to an existing cell, or create a new cell with this new folder.
