In this chapter you will see how to use another main feature of pydio Cells "sharing", you will see all the means to share files, folders and more.

### Sharing with Cells

Cells is the new way to share with Pydio, a cell is a space where you and the invited people have access to the same resources, you can control the access to the said resources and even more.
Roughly speaking a cell is a workspace with a group of invited people/groups (you can invite as many as you want) that have access to the same resources and can modify them and such.


Now let's see how you can use cells, there is two ways to create a cell.

The main way is by going on your **HOME** page and clicking the **Create a Cells** button located in the menu on the left sidebar.

#### Create a Cell :
Then you will have the following menu displaying :

* **Title** : the name for the cell.
* **Description** : you can add a short Description of your cell.

Click on **Next**

![Create User workspace](/images/2_getting_started/create_cell_2.png)

* **Users/groups** : You can now choose a single or multiple groups/users that will have access to this cell. You can also choose how they can interact within it.

* **Add an existing Folder** : You can either choose an existing folder and the cell will be created within this folder or let Pydio create an empty folder for you.

Click on **Go** now your cell is created.

Within a cell you can use the same features as if you where using a workspace such as compressing files, etc ...


#### Another way to create cells :

You can right click on any folder and choose **Share** now you will be able to either add this folder to an existing cell or create a new cell with this new folder.

### Sharing with Public links

You can also share using a public link, to create a public link choose the folder/file that you want to share and right click on it a menu will appear click on **Share** then you will have the following menu :

![Create User workspace](/images/2_getting_started/public_link_1.png)

Click on **Enable Public Links** to enable them.

Now you will have new fields displaying to you.

* **Link Label** : The label of your link(you have a menu displaying all of your public links and to recognize them you can put a label)

* **Link Description** : It will be autofield with the date of creation, but you can also add a short description to it if you wish.

Then there is 3 different tabs :

1. **Link** : This is where you can get your link, you can also choose the permissions that users have on this share.
2. **Access** : You can choose if you want to put a password an expiration date for the link, a limited number of downloads and the layout of the GUI when people are on the link.
3. **Visibility** : You can choose to whom this link will be visible on the shares menu.
