As you can see this is the default setup of the dashboard displaying the connection number of the day, downloads of the day, uploads this week , the files activity, recent events and server status and a to do list.

#### Edit the Dashboard

By default you can move the widgets by drag and dropping them, if you want to further edit the dashboard, you'll have to click on the **green pen** on the bottom right, a right bar menu will display allowing you to add widgets or also remove the current ones.

For instance you can add graphs *small* or *big* and customize them choose for example the sampling frequency, what data it's going to use (downloads, uploads, etc...)
you can also add widgets displaying the events and such, like *server status*, *most active* and so on so forth, like the previous widgets you can choose your sampling frequency, etc...
