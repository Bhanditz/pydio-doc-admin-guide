What are the new features packed in with Pydio Cells, what's new lets take a look at all of them.

### What's new with Pydio Cells

What's different from the old versions of *Pydio* and *Pydio Cells* is that we are introducing the concept of cells, datasources, policies, micro-services and object-storage.

#### Cells

Let's start with cells the new way to share, cells are basically a workspace and a group tied together allowing you to share with anyone and control all of that in the same space, the cell.

#### Datasources

Datasources are an object storage file system allowing you to expand it to your will.

#### [ED]Policies

Policies are the new way to restrict access, features, ... with more details, you can choose the time, the day etc...

#### Micro services

Micro services as they are defined by their name, are small services that serves one simple task, but once you put them together they will serve a greater scheme. They give you the ability to stop/restart, modify or update each one without them impacting all of the other services.

You can get a look at the services status in **Backend > Services**.
