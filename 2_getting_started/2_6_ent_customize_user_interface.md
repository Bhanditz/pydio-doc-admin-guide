_Note: This is an Enterprise Edition feature_ 

To customize your UI go to the admin Settings, then to **All Plugins > Available Plugins > Action Plugins** enable **Vanitizer**, reload the page (very important step) and then go back to your home page.

You now have a menu on the bottom left that looks like this:

[:image-popup:2_getting_started/ent_vanitizer.png]

With 3 different tabs:

- **Palette**: change the colors of the different items such as the menu bar or the buttons.
- **Css**: type raw CSS right here to modify some elements. We recommand you to use your browser's _Developer Tool_ allowing you to modify in live and see directly the end result.
- **Buttons**: add new buttons to either trigger a custom javascript or redirect to an external URL. The customization is pretty straight forward: you name your button, choose its location and icon and then put your link or js snippet.
