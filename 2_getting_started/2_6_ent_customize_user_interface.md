_Note: This is an Enterprise Edition feature_ 

To customize your UI go to the admin Settings, then to **All Plugins > Availble Plugins > Action Plugins** enable **Vanitizer**, reload the page (very important step) and then go back to your home page.
Now you will have a menu on the bottom left displaying it will look like this :

[:image-popup:2_getting_started/ent_vanitizer.png]

with 3 different tabs :

* **Palette** :

You have the color palette allowing you to change the colors of the different items such as the menu bar, the buttons.

* **Css** :

You can type raw CSS right here to modify some elements, we advise you to use your browser's Developer tool allowing you to modify in live and see directly the end result.

* **Buttons** :

You can add new buttons that have the ability to either trigger a custom javascript or redirect to an external URL. The customization is pretty straight forward you name your button, choose it's location, the icon and then put your link or js snippet.
