In this chapter we are going to see where you can find your enterprise license so that you have it during the installation process, we are also going to see how you can look at it's status with the pydio cells **[Enterprise Edition]** dashboard.

### Getting an enterprise license

#### Website

To find your **[Enterprise Edition]** go to pydio's website, **User account > my licenses** click on the first license that will take you to the extended menu where you will see a long string as seen in this screenshot :

#### Pydio cells dashboard (after installation)

*We assume that you already have installed pydio cells using the license that we provided you on the website*

Now to find your license go to **Backend > Enterprise License** :

As you can see you will have the validity of your license, it's remaining time, you can also mouse over the circle and display on the red part the count of actual users using the license and on the green part the remaining count of users that can use this license (if you need more users you can purchase a bigger license).
