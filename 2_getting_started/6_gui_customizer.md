In this section, we will explain you how to very simply change the GUI of Pydio with the Orbit theme.

## Run the branding tool:

First of all, you need to enable the branding tool.
To do so, please go to the administration dashboard,
then to Users Features > Appearance.

In the Main Options tab, make sure it's set like that:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_configure.png]

Make sure to save changes, go to any workspace on your Pydio server, then refresh the page.

You should see the branding tool showing up:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_start_enterprise.png]

Note that you also can modify theses images inside the enterprise Dashboard (Users Features > Appearance).

## Add buttons to interface:

You can add buttons in a selected menu in your interface:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_buttons.png]

Here are the settings for a button:

- Button Label
- Button Location (the part where you want your button to be displayed)
  - Global bar
  - Files button bar
  - More button menu (inside the "More" button in the files button bar)
- Button Icon (a small icon in the left of your button Label)
- You can choose between:
  - Button Link (paste the url of your webpage)
  - Link target (in the current page or in a new tab)
  - Write your own javascript code been called by clicking on the button


## Save settings:

When you have set everything, don't forget to save:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_save.png]

Then go to Users Features > Appearance. Disable the branding tool and load the saved config:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_configure2.png]

When you have done all these steps, you can go back to your workspace and see your changes.

Here is for example a completely custom interface:
