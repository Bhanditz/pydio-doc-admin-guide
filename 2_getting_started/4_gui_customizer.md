# GUI Options

In this section, we will explain you how to very simply change the GUI of Pydio with the Orbit theme.

Go to Users Features > GUI Options.
In the Main Options tab, make sure it's set like that:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_configure.png]

Make sure to save changes, then go to any workspace on your Pydio server.

You should see the branding tool showing up:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_start.png]


You can pick a color for each parts of the interface:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_colors.png]


You can change the Pydio images by yours:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_images.png]

Note that you also can modify theses images inside the enterprise Dashboard (Users Features > GUI Options).



You can add buttons in a selected menu in your interface:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_buttons.png]
With this button, you can open a web link or call some javascript code.


When you have set everything, don't forget to save:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_save.png]

Then go to Users Features > GUI Options. Disable the branding tool and load the saved config:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_configure2.png]

Here is for example a completely custom interface:
[:image-popup:2_getting_started/gui_result.png]
