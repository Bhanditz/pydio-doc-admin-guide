In this chapter, you will see how you can create and manage workspaces with Pydio Cells.

*You have to be on the settings to be able to do the operations below*

## Create a workspace

To create a workspace go to **Data Management > Workspaces**, then click on **+WORKSPACE** located on the right.

After this menu will appear : 

![Create User workspace](/images/2_getting_started/create_workspace.png)

**Driver Options**  

1. **Root nodes** : you can choose and add nodes that you have created with the storage menu as seen in the **[Managing Storage]()** guide.

**Set Generic Options** :

1. **Label** : This is the name of the workspace.

2. **Description** : You can put a description about what your workspace contains for example and such, you can put whatever you wish to.

3. **Default Rights** : You can choose Default Reading/Writting rights for this workspace.

4. **Alias** : You can use this to replace the generated unique id of the workspace (this will be usefull if you are going for example to modify this workspace through the cells API).

## Manage your Workspace

You can also edit your workspaces after the creation.

To modify a workspace go to **Data Management > Workspaces** and just left click the workspace of your choice, you will then have all the previous fields allowing you to modify them.

## Manage the rights to your workspace

The managment of rights for your workspaces goes through the users/groups/roles interface, so basically the access to them will depend on the access rights that you granted to users/groups/roles.

To have a better understanding of the rights you can read this **[guide]().
