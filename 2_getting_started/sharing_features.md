# Sharing with Pydio Cells

To share with Pydio cells you have many ways, but here you will see the most common ways to do that.

## Cells

Cells is the new way of sharing data with Pydio Cells. You can now easily share and manage data with multiple users/groups. A cell is a new space that enables you to share, attach one or multiple folders to it and expand it as much as you want.

### Sharing with Cells

There is two ways to create a cell.

The main way is by going on your **HOME** page and clicking the **Create a Cells** located in the menu on the left sidebar.

#### Create a Cell :
Then you will have the following menu displaying :

* **Title** : the name for the cell.
* **Description** : you can add a short Description of your cell.

Click on **Next**

* **Users/groups** : You can now choose a single or multiple groups/users that will have access to this cell. You can also choose how they can interact within it.

* **Add an existing Folder** : You can either choose an existing folder and the cell will be created within this folder or let Pydio create an empty folder for you.

Click on **Go** now your cell is created.

Within a cell you can use the same features as if you where using a workspace such as compressing files, etc ...


#### Another way to create cells :

You can right click on any folder and choose **Share** now you will be able to either add this folder to an existing cell or create a new cell with this new folder.
