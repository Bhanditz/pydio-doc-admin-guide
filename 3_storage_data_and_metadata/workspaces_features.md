The rights to access a given set of data for one or more users is handled at a workspace level. Thus, once you have created a workspace, you will be able to grant read and/or write access to this workspace to your users.

You can assign these permissions individually, but you can also create Roles and Policies, (basically, a set of rules) to _dynamically_ grant accesses and permissions to a set of users. More on this in section 4 of this guide.

In this section, we will explain:

- How to create and manage workspaces
- How to manage the specific _"Personal Files"_ folders
- The new _"Cells"_ concept that makes file and metadata sharing easy, userfriendly and very powerful.
