### Security policies

Security policies allow admin to restrict access to resources and can be created based on lots of criteria:

* the request source IP
* the access time
* the resource type
* the endpoint type
* etc...

How does a policy work?

Admin define condition and choose to allow or deny resources access if the condition matches.
