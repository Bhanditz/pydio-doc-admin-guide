## ./cells install

Pydio Cells Installer

### Synopsis

This command launch the installation process of Pydio Cells.

It will ask for the Bind Host to hook the webserver on a network interface IP, and you can set different hosts for accessing
the machine from outside world (if it is behind a proxy or inside a container with ports mapping for example).
You can launch this installer in non-interactive mode by providing --bind and --external. This will launch the browser-based
installer with SSL active using self_signed setup by default.

For example
- Bind Host : 0.0.0.0:8080
- External Host : share.mydomain.tld
Or
- Bind Host : share.mydomain.tld
- External Host : share.mydomain.tld
Or
- Bind Host : IP:1515       # internal port
- External Host : IP:8080   # external port mapped by docker
Or
- Bind Host : IP:8080
- External Host : IP:8080

It will open a browser to gather necessary information and configuration for Pydio Cells. if you don't have a browser access,
you can launch the command line installation using the install-cli command:

$ ./cells install-cli

Services will all start automatically after the install process is finished.
