## cells-ctl acl

Manage Access Control List

### Synopsis

ACL are managed in a dedicated micro-service.

ACLs are used to grant permissions to a given node Uuid for a given Role.


```
cells-ctl acl [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for acl
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
