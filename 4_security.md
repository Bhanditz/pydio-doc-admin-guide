[:image-popup:security.png]

The security Dashboard allows you to monitor who is currently connected to your Pydio server.

There is 2 distinct tables.
The first one is for the Web Sessions, it means people connected to Pydio with an internet browser.
The second one is for the API Sessions, it mean people connected with a synchronization client or with a mobile application.
