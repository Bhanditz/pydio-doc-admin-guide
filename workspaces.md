Workspace is a central concept in AjaXplorer, for both end-users and administrators. This chapter will explain you how a workspace creates a connexion to any type of data store, and how to enhance the features it provides with “meta” plugins.

**Workspaces ? Repositories ? What’s the difference? NONE!!** Repository and Workspace are exactly the same, repositories were renamed to workspace to be more consistent and user friendly at version 5.0. So please don’t be surprised if you see the term pop out from time to time!
