The uploader section allows you to manage the way you upload files to your server.
By default, Pydio is using the html5 uploader. But if you are using an old internet browser who doesn't support html5 features, you can activate the flash uploader for example.

You also can limit the number of simultaneous files uploads, and the maximum file size allowed.
