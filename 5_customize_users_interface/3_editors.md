What is an editor?
An editor is a specific plugin that allows you to open a kind of file.

For example, when you are browsing your files with the pydio website, if you want to open an image, you have different options to open that file (image preview, pixlr editor, ...).

The editor dashboard allows you to toggle which editor you want to activate on your pydio server.
