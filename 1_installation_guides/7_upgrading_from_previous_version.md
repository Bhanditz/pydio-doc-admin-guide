## Upgrading from a previous version

### From V8 and previous

Currently this operation is not possible because we have changed most of our code from PHP language to GO language.

### From Cells

The upgrade process from a previous Cells version is really easy, all you will have to do is :



1. **Download the latest binary [right here](link)**
2. **Replace your Old Binary with the newest**
3. **Empty your cache** : to empty the cache you can use `sudo rm -rf ~/.config/pydio/cells/static/pydio/.....`
4. **TBD**
