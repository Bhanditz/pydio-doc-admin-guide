_NOTE: upgrading from a previous major version of Pydio (typically 8 and below) is not possible because we have changed most of our code from PHP language to GO language. Now that the new version is stable and out, we are work on a migration process and we will provide you ASAP with a solution. If you are currently using en Enterprise version of Pydio 8 and need to migrate now, please get in touch directly with us._
