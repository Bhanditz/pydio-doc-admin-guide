_NOTE: upgrading from a previous major version of Pydio (typically 8 and below) is not possible because we have changed most of our code from PHP language to GO language. Now that the new version is stable and out, we are work on a migration process and we will provide you ASAP with a solution. If you are currently using en Enterprise version of Pydio 8 and need to migrate now, please get in touch directly with us._


### Upgrading from a previous version of Pydio Cells

Even if we put a strong effort on code quality, we know that we will surely find some bugs. 

Thus we have already prepared an upgrade workflow that is largely automated and really easy, all you will have to do is :


1. **Download the latest binary [right here](link)**
2. **Replace your Old Binary with the newest**
3. **Empty your cache** : to empty the cache you can use `sudo rm -rf ~/.config/pydio/cells/static/pydio/.....`
4. **TBD**
