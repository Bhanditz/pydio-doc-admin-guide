### How to use the Pydio Cells docker image

The Pydio cells image is designed to be used in a micro-service environment. It only contains what is strictly necessary to run the Pydio Cells binary and nothing more.

In order to have a fully working Pydio Cells environment, you need to run a database (MySQL or MariaDB) and a PHP-FPM (to handle the frontend) on the same network. A basic setup is described on this page.

#### Using the image

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 pydio/cells
```

You can now access the Pydio Cells installer at https://localhost:8080

#### External database

Pydio Cells requires a MySQL or MariaDB database. It is recommended to use a separate database and a dedicated user with access to that database. A basic configuration can be found in the docker-compose section of this guide.

#### External PHP-FPM

Pydio Cells requires a PHP-FPM process. The frontend files generated by the installer must be made available to the PHP-FPM. A basic configuration can be found in the docker-compose section of the guide.

Note: Pydio Cells uses php extensions functionalities that are not available by default in the official php-fpm containers. We provide a container based on the php:fpm-alpine

```sh
docker run -d -p 9000:9000 pydio/cells-php
```

If you prefer to use another version of the php-fpm container, you may still do so, but please bear in mind that some functionalities might be missing. Refer to the [Pydio Cells PHP container dockerfile](https://github.com/pydio/cells/blob/master/tools/docker/cells-php/Dockerfile) to ensure you install everything that is needed by the application 

#### Persistent data

All default configuration and data (`/root/.config` on the container) is saved in an unnamed volume.

If you want to use named volumes, here is an overview of the important files :

- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/pydio.json` : main configuration file
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/data` : data
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/logs` : logs
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/services` : services information
- `/root/.config/pydio/cells/static` : static frontend files

Note: If you [add new datasources](https://pydio.com/fr/docs/cells/v1/managing-datasources) and want to persist the data, ensure that their location is also mounted in a volume.
