### How to use the Pydio Cells docker image

The Pydio cells image is designed to be used in a micro-service environment. It only contains what's strictly necessary to run the Pydio Cells binary and nothing more.

In order to have a fully working Pydio Cells environment, you therefore need to run in the same network a database (MySQL or MariaDB) and a PHP-FPM to handle the frontend. A basic setup is described on this page.

#### Using the image

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 pydio/cells
```

You can now access the Pydio Cells installer at https://localhost:8080

#### External database

Pydio Cells requires a MySQL or MariaDB database. It is recommended to use a separate database and a dedicated user with access to that database. A basic configuration can be found in the docker-compose section of this guide.

#### External PHP-FPM

Pydio Cells requires a PHP-FPM process. The frontend files generated by the installer must be made available to the PHP-FPM. A basic configuration can be found in the docker-compose section of thie guide.
