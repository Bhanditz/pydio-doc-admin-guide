_NOTE: upgrading from a previous major version of Pydio (typically 8 and below) is not possible because we have changed most of our code from PHP language to GO language. Now that the new version is stable and out, we are working on a migration process and we will provide you ASAP with a solution. If you are currently using an Enterprise version of Pydio 8 and need to migrate now, please get in touch directly with us._


### Upgrading from a previous version of Pydio Cells

The upgrade process is easily done, you just have to go to **Backend > Upgrade** and then click on check now, after that if there is any update avaiable it will appear.
