## Upgrading from a previous version

Currently this operation is not possible because we have changed most of our code from PHP language to GO language.

You can will have to install Pydio Cells and then you will be able to reuse your data that is comming from a previous Pydio Version, you will have to map it to the datasources.

We will provide you with a solution.
